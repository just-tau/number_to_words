# number_to_words
C# code, aids in converting number to its equivalent in words.

**Note**: 
1. It capitalizes the first letter of the first word, but does not add any special characters like comma, or full-stop
2. It uses the International number naming system, i.e., using millions,billions, etc instead of lakhs,crores,etc.
